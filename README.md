Converts Unity Assets folders with random names into classical hierarchical named folders. 

So you can easily use the assets bought in the Unity Store outside of Unity

Works with Poneti's icons set https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/4000-fantasy-icons-163280

### Make it work ###

* Be sure to have Python installed

* Get the assets folder from Unity : https://support.unity.com/hc/en-us/articles/205578249-Can-I-download-an-Asset-without-opening-the-Unity-Editor-Is-it-possible-to-use-Unity-Assets-within-another-game-engine-

* Unzip the assets into a folder named "DirectoryAssets" . Make sure that the "random named folders" are the direct children of DirectoryAssets

* In the folder containing DirectoryAssets, launch a console (PowerShell on windows) and launch the script with "python .\unity_asset_converter.py"

* Get the Result folder and enjoy !
